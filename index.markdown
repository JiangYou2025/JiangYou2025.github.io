## Overview
<a name="overview"></a>
Time series forecasting involves predicting future values based on previously observed values. This is crucial in numerous fields, including finance, weather prediction, and inventory management. 

In this lecture, we cover the following key topics:

- **Fundamentals of Time Series Forecasting**: Introduction to the core concepts and terminology.
- **Statistic Techniques**: Overview of popular forecasting methods such as AutoRegressive Moving Average, and ARIMA, Support Vector Regressor.
- **Deep Learning Techniques**: Overview of popular forecasting methods such as Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM), Transformer and State Space Model (SSM, Mamba).
- **Practical Applications**: Real-world examples and applications of time series forecasting.
