## Overview
<a name="overview"></a>
Time series forecasting involves predicting future values based on previously observed values. This is crucial in numerous fields, including finance, weather prediction, and inventory management. In this project, we cover the following key topics:

- **Fundamentals of Time Series Forecasting**: Introduction to the core concepts and terminology.
- **Common Techniques**: Overview of popular forecasting methods such as Moving Average, Exponential Smoothing, and ARIMA.
- **Practical Applications**: Real-world examples and applications of time series forecasting.

## Chapters

This project is divided into several chapters, each focusing on a specific aspect of time series forecasting:

1. [Chapter 1: Time Series Forecasting in Machine Learning](/documentation/chapter1/)
2. [Chapter 2: Natural Language Processing in Machine Learning](/documentation/chapter2/)

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, you can navigate to the chapters listed above. Each chapter provides in-depth information and examples to help you understand and apply time series forecasting techniques.
