# Time Series Forecasting with ARIMA

## Introduction
Time series forecasting involves making predictions about future data points based on historical patterns. ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) is a popular statistical method used for this purpose. This guide will walk you through the basics of ARIMA and how to implement it in Python.

## What is ARIMA?
ARIMA stands for AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average. It combines three components:
- *AutoRegression (AR):* Uses the dependency between an observation and a number of lagged observations (previous time steps).
- *Integrated (I):* Uses differencing of raw observations to make the time series stationary (i.e., to remove trends).
- *Moving Average (MA):* Uses dependency between an observation and a residual error from a moving average model applied to lagged observations.

## Understanding ARIMA Components
ARIMA models are defined by three parameters: (p, d, q).
- *p (AR order):* The number of lag observations included in the model.
- *d (Differencing order):* The number of times that the raw observations are differenced.
- *q (MA order):* The size of the moving average window.

## Steps to Apply ARIMA
1. *Visualize the Time Series Data:* Plot your data to understand its structure.
2. *Check for Stationarity:* Use statistical tests like the Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test.
3. *Make the Series Stationary:* Apply differencing if necessary.
4. *Determine ARIMA Parameters:* Use techniques like the Autocorrelation Function (ACF) and Partial Autocorrelation Function (PACF).
5. *Fit the ARIMA Model:* Use statistical software or libraries to fit the model to your data.
6. *Make Predictions:* Forecast future values using the fitted model.
7. *Evaluate the Model:* Use metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) or Mean Absolute Error (MAE).

## Implementing ARIMA in Python
Python provides the `statsmodels` library, which has built-in support for ARIMA models. Hereâ€™s a basic workflow:

### Install Required Libraries
```bash
pip install pandas numpy statsmodels matplotlib
